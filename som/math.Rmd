### Procedure

1. Initialize weights random -1..1
2. Using inputs find the Best Matching Unit based on euclidean distance

$$ \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(p_i-q_i)^2}$$

3. Update weights in the region of the BMU using scaling functions theta and alpha where theta is the nighborhood function and alpha is the per iteration learning rate.

$$ W_v(t+1) = W_v(t) + \theta(v,t) \times \alpha(t) \times (X(t) - W_v(t)) $$

4. Use the Gaussian function as a radial basis function for neighbour weighting (x1,x2 are the row and column disctnaces from the BMU)

$$ f(x_1,x_2) = e^{-v} $$

$$ v = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{x_i-c^2}{2w^2} $$
